					<h3>Overview</h3>
					<p>
						IdaGem is an educational game designed for 4th-grade students,
						blending Idaho history lessons with interactive gameplay to create
						an engaging and effective learning experience. Developed in
						collaboration with Idaho teachers, IdaGem aligns with the state’s
						required curriculum and transforms traditional lessons into an
						immersive digital environment. Targeting young students aged 9-11,
						the game centers around a virtual version of the Idaho Anne Frank
						Memorial, a hub area where students can explore, learn, and interact
						with NPCs representing various professions, such as historians,
						explorers, and police officers.

						<br /><br />
						The purpose of IdaGem is to make learning history more engaging and
						meaningful by integrating game mechanics like avatar customization,
						in-game currency, and leaderboards. Students complete lessons,
						quizzes, and creative activities to reinforce their knowledge, all
						while earning rewards to personalize their experience. Two
						minigames—a fishing challenge and a randomized maze—add competitive
						and skill-based elements to keep students motivated and invested.
						IdaGem also inspires creativity through a Minecraft-style exhibit
						builder, encouraging students to demonstrate understanding in a fun
						and visual way. With quizzes, achievements, and exploration
						incentives, IdaGem turns learning into an adventure, fostering
						curiosity and retention of historical knowledge.

							<h4><strong>Creating Accounts & Classrooms</strong></h4>
							<p>
								IdaGem allows both teachers and students to create their own
								accounts. The teacher accounts can create and manage their
								classrooms, as well as choose to either approve or deny student
								submissions. The student accounts can complete lessons and play
								various minigames.

								<br /><br />

								In the classroom management, teachers can view the lesson
								progress of all of their students. This allows teachers to see
								which students are excelling and which students may need
								additional help. By being able to view submitted answers,
								teachers can provide feedback and help students improve their
								understanding of the material.

							<h4><strong>Learning Experience</strong></h4>
							<p>
								<span class="project_info"
									>Idaho Anne Frank Human Rights Memorial:</span
								><br />
								In collaboration with the
								<a href="https://www.wassmuthcenter.org/" class="link"
									>Wassmuth Center for Human Rights</a
								>, the HUB world of IdaGem is a virtual recreation of the Idaho
								Anne Frank Human Rights Memorial. Students can explore the
								memorial and learn about human rights and the history of Anne
								Frank.

								<br /><br />

								<span class="project_info">Idaho History:</span><br />
								In addition to what students can learn in the lessons
								themselves, there are a large amount of NPCs that students can
								interact with to learn more about Idaho history. These NPCs
								include a variety of professions, such as historians, explorers,
								and police officers. Students can learn about the history of
								Idaho from these NPCs, and even be quizzed on the information
								they learn.

								<br /><br />

								<span class="project_info">Lessons & Quests:</span><br />
								Students can learn about Idaho history through a variety of
								lessons and activities. These lessons cover a wide range of
								topics, from the Lewis and Clark expedition to the history of
								Idaho's Native American tribes.

								<br /><br />

								<span class="project_info">Exhibit Builder:</span><br />
								When a lesson has been completed, students can create their own
								exhibits to demonstrate their understanding of the material.
								Students can place various objects and NPCs in their exhibit to
								create a visual representation of what they have learned. If the
								build is approved by the teacher, it will be displayed in the
								Wassmuth Center for other students to see. This is with the
								intention of encouraging students to think creatively and show
								off what they have learned in a fun and engaging way.

							<h4><strong>Student Engagement</strong></h4>
							<p>
								One of the main goals of IdaGem is to make learning history more
								engaging and fun so that students are more likely to retain the
								information they learn. To help with this, IdaGem has a variety
								of features that help to keep students engaged and motivated to
								learn.

								<br /><br />

								<span class="project_info">Avatar Customization:</span><br />
								Students can customize their avatars with a variety of clothing
								and accessories through the gems they earn from completing
								lessons and minigames. This allows students to personalize their
								experience and show off their achievements.

								<br /><br />

								<span class="project_info">Minigames:</span><br />
								There are two minigames in IdaGem that students can play to earn
								extra gems: <br />
								<br />
								The first minigame is a fishing minigame where students can
								catch fish to earn gems. Most of the fish that can be caught are
								based on what can actually be found in the Boise River, which
								the Idaho Anne Frank Human Rights Memorial is located next to.
								There are some extra rare fish that can be caught as well, which
								are more wacky and occasionally mythological, such as a sea
								serpent. These rare fish are harder to catch, but they are worth
								more gems.

								<br /><br />

								The second minigame is a maze minigame where students can earn
								gems by completing a randomized maze. The maze is procedurally
								generated, so it is different each time it is played. Students
								have to get to the end of the maze before time runs out in order
								to complete it. There are also NPCs randomly spread throughout
								the maze that students can interact with to answer various
								questions about Idaho history. If students answer the questions
								correctly, they will be rewarded with both extra gems and time.
								Their final score is based on how many answers they get correct
								and how quickly they complete the maze.

								<br /><br />

								Both of these minigames have their own leaderboards, so students
								can compete with each other to see who can get the highest
								score.

								<br /><br />

								<span class="project_info">Achievements:</span><br />
								Students can earn achievements by completing various tasks in
								the game. These achievements are displayed in the pause menu,
								and students can earn gems by completing them. These
								achievements range From walking a certain distance, to finding a
								hidden sasquatch multiple times, to getting high scores. This is
								with the intention of keeping students engaged and motivated to
								explore the game.

							<h4><strong>Sound</strong></h4>
							<p>
								In order to make the game more immersive and engaging for the
								students, IdaGem has a variety of sound effects and music that
								play throughout the game. These sounds range from the sound of
								the fish splashing in the fishing minigame to the sound of the
								bikers riding past along the Green Belt trail. We have multiple
								music tracks that play throughout the game in order to set the
								mood and tone of the experience.

					<h3>Challenges & Takeaways</h3>
					<p>
						Developing IdaGem presented unique challenges, from balancing
						educational content with engaging gameplay to leading a
						multi-disciplinary team. Each obstacle was an opportunity to refine
						my problem-solving, leadership, and technical skills.

						<br /><br />

						This project was an incredibly rewarding experience, pushing me to
						merge creativity with structure while ensuring accessibility and
						real-world usability. The lessons I learned—particularly in
						technical problem-solving, team leadership, and user-focused
						design—continue to shape my approach to game development.
