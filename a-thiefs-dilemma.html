							<h4><strong>Act 1</strong></h4>
							<p>
								<span class="project_info">Story:</span><br />
								The first act of A Thief's Dilemma stories the prison escape of
								our protagonist, Mac. He is a master thief that can use quantum
								powers through the use of mysterious pills. He receives the
								opportunity to escape using one of these pills, as long as he
								agrees to one last job...
							</p>
							<p>
								<span class="project_info">Style:</span><br />
								As our story starts off relatively normal, the art style is
								primarily a black and white, hand-drawn look. The game for this
								section is the prison break of the act. This is shown through a
								3D, maze-like prison that the player has to navigate through.
							</p>
							<p>
								<span class="project_info">Quantum Mechanic Focus:</span><br />
								The quantum mechanic we explored in this act was Wave Particle
								Duality. This is represented through the player being able to
								turn from their normal particle form to a wave-based form that
								distorts the world around them. When in this wave form, Mac can
								move through various cell bars to progress further through the
								prison.

							<h4><strong>Act 2</strong></h4>
							<p>
								<span class="project_info">Story:</span><br />
								Act 2 delves into the heist that centers our story, as well as
								our protagonist's future. At this point, the use of the pills
								have begun to distort Mac's perception of reality.
							</p>
							<p>
								<span class="project_info">Style:</span><br />
								As a result, the art has now become pixel art, with the central
								game mechanic being an "endless" runner of avoiding obstacles.
							</p>
							<p>
								<span class="project_info">Quantum Mechanic Focus:</span><br />
								The quantum mechanic we explored in this act was Quantum
								Entanglement. This is represented through the protagonist
								splitting himself into two, with the copy being an opposite of
								himself. This makes the "endless" runner game section more
								difficult, as you have to focus on two runners at the same time,
								with each reacting to controls in opposite ways.

							<h4><strong>Act 3</strong></h4>
							<p>
								<span class="project_info">Story:</span><br />
								The final act of our story finds our protagonist after his
								successful heist. However, with the success of stealing his
								target prize, he finds himself completely losing his perception
								of reality, leading to dire consequences.
							</p>
							<p>
								<span class="project_info">Style:</span><br />
								By this point, Mac now sees the world in an abstract, 2D point
								of view. The world changes visually almost constantly, and the
								foreground is made of simple shapes, to the point where nothing
								is concrete. The central game mechanic is now a 2D side
								scrolling platformer, with the ability to reverse time.
							</p>
							<p>
								<span class="project_info">Quantum Mechanic Focus:</span><br />
								The quantum mechanic we explored in this act was the Flow of
								Time. This is represented through a mechanic of reversing Mac
								through his previous locations of up to 10 seconds. Through this
								mechanic, the player is able to progress through a series of
								difficult rooms and puzzles, and hopefully avoid the madness
								that comes with it.

							<h4><strong>End</strong></h4>
							<p>
								At the end of Mac's journey, he realizes that his newfound
								freedom is not worth the distorted world that he now finds
								himself in. As a result, he decides to use this newfound
								time-reversal to undo everything that has happened, sending the
								player, and himself, back to the very beginning of our story.

					<h3>Challenges</h3>
					<p>
						The biggest challenge of this project was the constant change in art
						style. Finding ways to present this to the player in a way that was
						not jarring was a difficult task. We also had to ensure that the
						story was still coherent and engaging, despite the changes
						throughout. Ultimately, we were able to succeed in this task by
						ensuring that the changes were gradual and that the story was still
						the central focus of the project.
						<br />
						<br />
						Another large challenge was the development of the game mechanics.
						We had to ensure that the mechanics were not only unique to the
						respective section of the story, but also engaging to the player.
						This was done through a series of playtests and feedback sessions,
						which allowed us to refine the mechanics to be more engaging and fun
						for the player.
